# Table in Markdown

## This is a level two header

Name          | Age        | Coolness         | Superpower    
---           | ---        | ---              | ---
Crystal       | 16         | very             | yay 
Mr. Ubial     | Pretty old | His kids think he's cool | he can nap anywhere 

To make a list we use the following:

* this is the first item in the list
* this is the second item in the list 
    * this is actually a subpoint in this list 

- this is also a list
- you can use these as bullets as well
    - you can also use sublists with dashes

1. this is the first item in an ordered list 
3. this is the second 
    - this is unordered
    - same here 

# Blockquote 

these are usually used to show quotes, things people have said
